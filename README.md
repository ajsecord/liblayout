# liblayout

This is version 0.1 of "liblayout", an experimental 2D layout library for 2D orthogonal rectangle packing.

Of note:

1. The license is the Lesser General Public License (LPGL), see lpgl.txt for the 
full license.  
2. The language is C (ANSI C99), for ease of linking with other languages.
3. Code documentation has fairly high coverage, and is generated automatically 
from the code by Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).

There's a little OpenGL/GLUT desktop app in `sample/`.
